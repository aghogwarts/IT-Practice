1. **Inline CSS -** it uses the sytle attribute in any HTML start tag. It is used to apply CSS on a single line or element. For example -
```html
<p style="color:blue">Hello CSS</p>
```
2. **Embedded or Internal CSS -** it is used to apply CSS on a single page or a class of elements. It is used within the style tag in the head section of a webpage. For example -
```html
!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
h1{color:red;}
</style></head>
<body>
<h1>The Internal CSS is applied on this heading.</h1>
<p>This won't be affected</p>
</body>
</html>
